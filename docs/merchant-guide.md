**Q: "I don't have Bitcoin or STX."**  
A: "You can buy Bitcoin on apps like Cash App, Coinbase, or buy STX on Binance, OKX. Or use a Stacks wallet like Xverse that has built-in purchasing."

**Q: "What's STX and why should I use it?"**  
A: "STX is faster (6 seconds vs 10+ minutes) and cheaper ($0.01 vs $1-5) than Bitcoin. It automatically converts to sBTC for your purchase."

**Q: "How long does it take?"**  
A: "STX payments: 6 seconds. Bitcoin payments: 10-30 minutes. You'll get email confirmation when complete."

**Q: "Can I get a refund?"**
