# Customer Guide - Paying with Bitcoin

**Audience**: Online Shoppers and Consumers  
**Goal**: Understand and complete Bitcoin payments safely  
**No Technical Knowledge Required**

## 🛒 What is Bitcoin Payment?

### Simple Explanation

**Bitcoin payment** is like using digital cash online. Instead of entering your credit card details, you send digital money directly from your phone or computer to the store.

**Think of it like:**

- Venmo, but worldwide and instant
- Cash, but digital and trackable
- A bank transfer, but with no banks involved

### Why Stores Offer Bitcoin Payment

**Lower costs** → Stores save money on fees  
**No chargebacks** → Protects stores from fraud  
**Global reach** → Anyone worldwide can pay  
**Privacy** → No need to share credit card details
