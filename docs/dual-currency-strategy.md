# Dual-Currency Payment Strategy

**The Perfect Hackathon Approach: Bitcoin + STX Options**

## üéØ Why Both Bitcoin AND STX?

### Customer Choice Philosophy

**Different customers have different needs:**

- **Bitcoin Users**: Already have Bitcoin, trust the network, prefer decentralization
- **STX Users**: Want speed, low fees, modern wallet experience
- **New Users**: Can choose based on their priorities (security vs speed)

### Technical Innovation

**Single sBTC Endpoint**: Both payment methods convert to sBTC for merchants
**Unified Experience**: Same API, same webhooks, same dashboard
**Maximum Compatibility**: Works with all major wallets
**Future-Proof**: Ready for sBTC ecosystem growth

## üí° Customer Decision Matrix

| Customer Type       | Likely Choice | Why                                                       |
| ------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Crypto Veterans** | Bitcoin       | "I trust Bitcoin, I have Bitcoin, I use Bitcoin"          |
| **DeFi Users**      | STX           | "I'm already in Stacks ecosystem, want fast transactions" |
| **Speed Buyers**    | STX           | "I want to buy now, not wait 30 minutes"                  |
| **Security First**  | Bitcoin       | "Bitcoin is proven, I want maximum security"              |
| **Fee Conscious**   | STX           | "$0.01 fee vs $5? Easy choice"                            |
| **Mobile Users**    | STX           | "Wallet connection is smoother than QR codes"             |

## üöÄ Hackathon Demo Flow

### Demo Script: "The Power of Choice"

**Minute 1: Problem Setup**

> "Traditional payment processors limit customer options. Bitcoin is slow. Other cryptos aren't Bitcoin-backed."

**Minute 2: Solution Introduction**

> "We give customers choice: Bitcoin for security, STX for speed. Both become sBTC for merchants."

**Minute 3: Bitcoin Payment Demo**

```
Customer: "I have Bitcoin, I trust Bitcoin"
Action: Shows Bitcoin QR code payment
Result: "Traditional crypto payment, merchant gets sBTC"
```

**Minute 4: STX Payment Demo**

```
Customer: "I want to pay now, not wait"
Action: Xverse wallet connects, 6-second payment
Result: "Modern Web3 payment, merchant gets same sBTC"
```

**Minute 5: Merchant Dashboard**

```
Dashboard: Shows both payments
Result: "Same API, same sBTC, different customer preferences satisfied"
```

## üìä Technical Implementation

### API Design

```javascript
// Single payment creation endpoint handles both
POST /api/v1/payments
{
  "amount": 5000000, // Amount in satoshis
  "currency": "usd",
  "description": "Wireless Headphones",
  "payment_methods": ["bitcoin", "stx"], // Customer can choose
  "customer_email": "customer@example.com"
}

// Response includes both payment options
{
  "id": "pay_123",
  "amount": 5000000,
  "payment_urls": {
    "bitcoin": "https://pay.gateway.com/btc/pay_123",
    "stx": "https://pay.gateway.com/stx/pay_123"
  },
  "payment_details": {
    "bitcoin": {
      "address": "bc1q...",
      "amount_btc": "0.00050000",
      "qr_code": "data:image/png;base64,..."
    },
    "stx": {
      "amount_stx": "12500",
      "smart_contract": "SP...sbtc-payment",
      "supported_wallets": ["xverse", "hiro", "leather"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Unified Webhook Response

```javascript
// Same webhook format regardless of payment method
{
  "type": "payment.completed",
  "data": {
    "object": {
      "id": "pay_123",
      "amount": 5000000, // Always in satoshis sBTC
      "payment_method": {
        "type": "bitcoin" | "stx",
        "details": {
          // Method-specific details
        }
      },
      "merchant_receives": "5000000 satoshis sBTC" // Always the same!
    }
  }
}
```
